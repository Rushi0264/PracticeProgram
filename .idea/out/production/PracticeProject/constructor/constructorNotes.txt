What is Constructor in Java?
=> Are a special type of method used to initialize an Object of a class.

During initialization process constructor assigns default
values to variables of a class.

Constructor
=> used to initialize an Object of a class
=> it returns nothing => no return type allowed
=> you don't need to call Constructor => it will get called as soon we create
                                        an Object of a class.
=> Constructor name must be same as class name

Method
=> perform specific tasks or write business logic
=> might return us something
=> you need to call the method then will it will get executed
=> method name can or can not be same as class name


Imp Points
1) When developer does not provide any Constructor, JVM provides a Constructor in class and that
Constructor is called as Default Constructor.

2) When Developer provides a Constructor in class then JVM will not provide
us default Constructor.

3) First line in any Constructor is a call to Parent class no-arg Constructor, this line is added by JVM.
(Developer does not need to write this line).




JVM       => default
developer => no-argument

Types of Constructor
1) No-argument
2) Parameterized
